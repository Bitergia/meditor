Model Editor: Create models to organize metrics

The goal of this project is to create a web editor (using Django) for creating models that are used to show metrics in a meaning way.

In the initial version the metrics supported will be the [CROSSMINER ones](https://github.com/crossminer/crossminer/tree/dev/web-dashboards/ossmeter-metrics).

Based on the models, visualizations for metrics are generated. In the inital version
Kibana dashoards will be created using [GrimoireLab](http://grimoirelab.github.io/).
